        content: "Hey, everyone. I'm Kendall, and I started this blog to dump my thoughts onto the interwebs and to add something to my software/web dev portfolio. This is daunting, as I've never been a very public person, but I've personally experienced the power of communication over the past few years--sometimes thrusted into the fray, other times making my voice heard on my own volition. These experiences yielded net-positive and net-negative consequences. But it is because of these consequences that I'm writing this blog post in this moment: as a human being using discernment with a human brain and human mind, I am convinced that the positive and the negative make this whole thing worthwhile. I am convinced that sharing some of the lessons I've learned or trains of thought I've picked up along the way makes this whole thing worthwhile. That may be something to ponder and research. What amount of information, and what happens in the brain when one truly considers themself convinced? Anyway, I am also motivated by my journaling and the conversations I've had with others concerning some of the thoughts I've copied and pasted from mind to paper. I'll probably be posting a few times a week. I don't really have a schedule yet. The most recent post will be at the top of my feed, but all posts will have tags you can search for. I'll also place each post into a category. You can select categories from the hamburger menu. Check out my bio to learn more about me. Also, feel free to follow me on socials. Thanks for joining me as I toggle the visibility of my many wandering thoughts from private to public."
