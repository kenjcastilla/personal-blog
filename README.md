# Unsolicited Verbosity
This is a blog written in TypeScript with NextJS. I learned TypeScript through the [NextJS Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) and by building this project. I also used Tailwind CSS for the first time.

## Key Features
*Home*

  * Shows the title of the blog and a featured blog post.

*Posts*

  * Displays a search bar to filter posts by tags as well as a div with previews of all relevant posts.

*" "*

  * Displays a Quote of the Week. I might change to Quote of the Day. Or update bi-weekly.

## Next Steps
I plan to add a comment/question feature within the next month so that visitors can engage with me and the ideas I've presented. The feature will require the user to categorize their message as a question or a comment. I didn't originally plan to have people create accounts to engage with my posts. Therefore, the manifestation of this plan depends on whether I want to include accounts and more authentication involvement or just keep comments/questions anonymous.
